We have two different approaches to installing Pinax. The best approach is to
download our stable release and follow the "Released tarball instructions".
The benefit to this approach is that it requires absolutely no Internet
connection once you have downloaded the tarball.

The alternative approach is to start from the development version. You can
take this approach by following the "Development instructions". This means
you will be working with the bleeding edge of our code. We can not guarantee
any stability.

.. note::

	If you are on OS X be sure you have the Apple developer tools installed.

Released tarball instructions
=============================

We have provided a script that will create a virtual environment for you.
Once you have downloaded the release tarball, cd into the extracted directory.
Let's create a virtual environment that you will install everything into::

    $ python scripts/pinax-boot.py ../pinax-env
    $ cd ../
    $ source ./pinax-env/bin/activate
    (pinax-env)$

Note that we have told you to create the new environment in the directory
above the tarball directory. We encourage you create the environment anywhere
you like.

If you use virtualenvwrapper (we highly encourage you do), you can easily
replace ../ with your WORKON_HOME. This gives you regular access to workon
to activate your environment.

You can skip the "Development instructions" section and begin reading the
"Common to both approaches" section.

Development instructions
========================

Download the latest pinax-boot.py script (you can put this anywhere, we will
assume current working directory)::

    $ curl -O http://github.com/pinax/pinax/raw/master/scripts/pinax-boot.py

Create a virtual environment with the downloaded script::

    $ python pinax-boot.py --development ./pinax-env
    $ source ./pinax-env/bin/activate
    (pinax-env)$

The last step to pull down the external apps and libraries. To do this run::

    (pinax-env)$ cd ./pinax-env/
    (pinax-env)$ pip install --requirement src/pinax/requirements/external_apps.txt

Common to both approaches
=========================

Your next step is to create a Pinax project. Let's first check what is
available::

    (pinax-env)$ pinax-admin clone_project -l

This will show you a list of project that you can base your new project off
of. For the purpose of testing Pinax, let's start with the social_project::

    (pinax-env)$ pinax-admin clone_project social_project mysite

This will create a new Pinax project called 'mysite' in your current working
directory. Lastly, let's get it running::

    (pinax-env)$ cd mysite/
    (pinax-env)$ python manage.py syncdb
    (pinax-env)$ python manage.py runserver

Point your browser at http://localhost:8000/ and you should see the Pinax
default homepage!
