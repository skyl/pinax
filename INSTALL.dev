This covers installation of the development version of Pinax.

We would like to warn you now that you will be using a version of Pinax that
may not be entirely stable. If you are looking to run Pinax in a production
environment we recommend you download the latest stable release from
http://pinaxproject.com/download/.

There are two different ways you might want to install a development release
of Pinax:

1) You want to try the latest code and don't mind if a tool clones Pinax for
   you and installs it.

2) You are looking to contribute to Pinax and need to setup your environment
   to commit back.

If you are looking for 2 you can move along to our online contributing
documentation located at http://pinaxproject.com/docs/dev/contributing.html.

The rest of the file will cover 1.

To install a development version of Pinax you will first need the
pinax-boot.py script. pinax-boot.py is a slightly modified version of
virtualenv:

    curl -O http://github.com/pinax/pinax/raw/master/scripts/pinax-boot.py

This file may need to be updated if you want to upgrade your environment to
a newer version of Pinax. You are now ready to create a virtual environment
that will hold your development version of Pinax:

    $ python pinax-boot.py --development pinax-env

The result of this command will be a new directory, pinax-env, that contains
a baseline environment containing pip, Django and Pinax. It contains no
dependancies at this point.

Activate this new environment:

    $ source pinax-env/bin/activate
    (pinax-env)$

If you are a virtualenvwrapper user the above two command could have been:

    $ python pinax-boot.py --development $WORKON_HOME/pinax-env
    $ workon pinax-env
    (pinax-env)$

Make sure that whenever we reference pinax-env you prefix it $WORKON_HOME/.
(That was a period, not a part of the prefix).

Now you are ready to install the Pinax dependancies:

    (pinax-env)$ pip install -r pinax-env/src/pinax/requirements/external_apps.txt

This may take some time as it needs to pull the packages down from the
Internet. Once it has completed you are ready to use Pinax! See
INSTALL.release "Starting a new Pinax project" section to continue.
